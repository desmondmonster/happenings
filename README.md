# Happenings

A light framework for building and publishing domain events.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'happenings'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install happenings

## Basic Usage

Start by creating a Plain Old Ruby Object for your domain event and including the `Happening::Event` module.
You'll want to declare an initialize method that sets up any needed variables.  Then, implement
a `#strategy` method and add your business logic there.  This method will be called when your
Happening Event is run.

```
class ResetPasswordEvent
  include Happenings::Event

  def initialize user, new_password, new_password_confirmation
    @user = user
    @new_password = new_password
    @new_password_confirmation = new_password_confirmation
  end

  def strategy
    if @new_password == @new_password_confirmation
      @user.reset_password! @new_password
      success! message: 'Password reset successfully'
    else
      failure! message: 'Password must match confirmation'
    end
  end
end
```

Run the event using the `#run` method as follows:

```
event = ResetPasswordEvent.new(user, 'secret_password', 'secret_password')
if event.run!
  # it worked, do something
  flash[:notice] = event.message
else
  # event failed for some reason
  flash[:error] = event.message
end
```

`#run!` will return Boolean `true` or `false` depending on the outcome of your strategy.
`#strategy` must return with `#success!` or `#failure!` or a `Happenings::OutcomeError` will
be raised.

## Success, Failure
`#success!` and `#failure!` will set a `succeeded?` attribute and set optional keys for 
`message` and `reason` attributes.  `message` is meant for human-readable messages, 
such as "Password reset failed", whereas `reason` is designed for machine-sortable
filtering, such as "confirmation\_mismatch".  An `elapsed_time` attribute is also recorded.


## Publishing
Happenings makes it easy to disseminate your business events to interested parties, such as
your analytics system, cache counters, or background workers.  Happenings will swallow the
events by default, but it's recommended that you set a publisher in the configuration (see below).
This publisher must respond to a `publish` method that accepts two arguments: the 
payload and a hash of additional info.  This arrangement is geared towards a message broker like
RabbitMQ, but you can certainly write your own wrapper for another messaging bus like Redis.

Publishing happens automatically when `#success!` is called.  The following methods are important:

`payload` - The main package of the event.  defaults to `{}`, but should
be overridden in your event to include useful info such as the user id, changed attributes, etc.
`routing_key` - The routable description of the event.  Defaults to `#{app_name}.#{event_name}`
`event_name` - A machine-filterable version of the event.  Defaults to the class name.

Here's an expanded version of our Reset Password example above that includes publishing features:

```
class MyEventPublisher
  require 'bunny'

  def initialize
    @rabbitmq = Bunny.new
    @rabbitmq.start
    @rabbitmq_channel = @rabbitmq.create_channel
    @events_exchange = @rabbitmq_channel.topic 'events', durable: true
  end

  def publish message, properties
    @events_exchange.publish JSON.dump(message), properties
  end
end


Happenings.configure do |config|
  config.publisher = MyEventPublisher.new
  config.app_name = 'my_app'
end

class ResetPasswordEvent
  include Happenings::Event

  attr_reader :user, :new_password, :new_password_confirmation

  def initialize user, new_password, new_password_confirmation
    @user = user
    @new_password = new_password
    @new_password_confirmation = new_password_confirmation
  end

  def strategy
    passwords_match? and
      reset_user_password!
  end

  def payload
    { user: { id: user.id } }
  end


  private

  def reset_user_password!
    user.reset_password! new_password
    success! message: 'Password reset successfully'
  end

  def passwords_match?
    if new_password == new_password_confirmation
      true
    else
      failure! message: 'Password must match confirmation'
    end
  end
end
```

If the event is successful, `MyEventPublisher#publish` will receive the following parameters:
```
message.inspect # => { user: { id: 2 },
                       event: 'resetpasswordevent',
                       reason: nil,
                       message: 'Password reset successfully',
                       elapsed_time: 0.15,
                       succeeded: true }

properties.inspect # => { message_id: <SecureRandom.uuid>,
                          routing_key: 'my_app.resetpasswordevent',
                          timestamp: <Time.now.to_i> }
```


## Configuration
You can change the Happenings configuration by passing a block to the `.configure` method.
If you're using Happenings with Rails, a good place for this setup is in an
initializer such as `config/initializers/happenings.rb`:

```
Happenings.configure do |config|
  config.logger = your_logger
  config.publisher = your_publisher
  config.app_name = 'my awesome app'
  config.socks = 'black socks'
end
```
