== 1.0.0 2014-10-30

 * [breaking change] set default event name to the class name, without
 underscores.  This removes a dependency on ActiveSupport.  To retain backward
 compatibility, call #underscore on your even_name.

== 0.2.0 2014-05-06

 * Removed #app_name method that forced users to declare one.  You can always
 add it back by subclassing the event_name.
 * Retain the module nesting of event name
